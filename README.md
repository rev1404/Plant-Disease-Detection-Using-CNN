# Plant Disease Detection using CNN

A complete mini-project for detecting plant diseases from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning system that can identify various plant diseases from leaf images. The model uses transfer learning with MobileNetV2 and can classify 12 different categories of plant health conditions.

## Features

- Multi-class classification (12 disease categories)
- Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2
- Data augmentation for robust training
- Real-time disease prediction
- Comprehensive visualization tools
- Model evaluation metrics

## Disease Categories

- **Apple**: Healthy, Scab, Black Rot
- **Corn**: Healthy, Common Rust, Northern Leaf Blight  
- **Potato**: Healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight
- **Tomato**: Healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight
